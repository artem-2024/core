## Welcome :)
The ```core``` is a modified version of [meikoz's Basic core](https://github.com/meikoz/Basic),on the basis of which I wrote my own thoughts,and after the author agreed to upload

## Where is the use ?
MVP,Retrofit,Beautiful log tool,Some widget...I will continue to update it

## Usage Gradle

build.gradle：
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.oreo:core:1.0.0'
}
```
application ：
```
extends the "MainApp", and add this code in the onCreate method

if (BuildConfig.DEBUG)
            Logcat.init("your package name").hideThreadInfo().methodCount(3);
```
## Thanks
Thank you, [meikoz](https://github.com/meikoz), you gave me a lot of inspiration

## Other
Maybe you need to fill in the ``` tools:replace="android:icon, android:theme"``` code in the AndroidManifest.xml <application/>.
